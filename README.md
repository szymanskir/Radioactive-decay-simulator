# Radioactive Decay Simulator

Simulator of radioactive decay using the Monte Carlo method implemented in form of a shiny application. Assignment for physics classes at the Warsaw University of Technology. The app is available on shinyapps: https://ryszard-szymaski.shinyapps.io/radioactive-decay-simulator/. However, if you want to run the application locally just follow the *Instructions* section.

# Instructions
The project uses `renv` to export used dependencies, after opening the project, `renv` should get automatically installed. To restore used dependencies just run the following command: 

```r
